0374537925,The Strange Bird: A Borne Story,109,2018,"<b><i>The Strange Bird</i>--from <i>New York Times</i> bestselling novelist Jeff VanderMeer--expands and weaves deeply into the world of his ""thorough marvel""* of a novel, <i>Borne</i>.</b><br /><br />The Strange Bird is a new kind of creature, built in a laboratory--she is part bird, part human, part many other things. But now the lab in which she was created is under siege and the scientists have turned on their animal creations. Flying through tunnels, dodging bullets, and changing her colors and patterning to avoid capture, the Strange Bird manages to escape.<br /><br />But she cannot just soar in peace above the earth. The sky itself is full of wildlife that rejects her as one of their own, and also full of technology--satellites and drones and other detritus of the human civilization below that has all but destroyed itself. And the farther she flies, the deeper she finds herself in the orbit of the Company, a collapsed biotech firm that has populated the world with experiments both failed and successful that have outlived the corporation itself: a pack of networked foxes, a giant predatory bear. But of the many creatures she encounters with whom she bears some kind of kinship, it is the humans--all of them now simply scrambling to survive--who are the most insidious, who still see her as simply something to possess, to capture, to trade, to exploit. Never to understand, never to welcome home.<br /><br />With <i>The Strange Bird, </i>Jeff VanderMeer has done more than add another layer, a new chapter, to his celebrated novel <i>Borne</i>. He has created a whole new perspective on the world inhabited by Rachel and Wick, the Magician, Mord, and Borne--a view from above, of course, but also a view from deep inside the mind of a new kind of creature who will fight and suffer and live for the tenuous future of this world.<br /><br /><b>Praise for <i>Borne</i></b><br /><br /><i>*</i>""Jeff VanderMeer's Southern Reach Trilogy was an ever-creeping map of the apocalypse; with <i>Borne</i> he continues his investigation into the malevolent grace of the world, and it's a thorough marvel."" --Colson Whitehead<br /><br />""VanderMeer is that rare novelist who turns to nonhumans not to make them approximate us as much as possible but to make such approximation impossible. All of this is magnified a hundredfold in <i>Borne </i>. . . Here is the story about biotech that VanderMeer wants to tell, a vision of the nonhuman not as one fixed thing, one fixed destiny, but as either peaceful or catastrophic, by our side or out on a rampage as our behavior dictates--for these are our children, born of us and now to be borne in whatever shape or mess we have created. This coming-of-age story signals that eco-fiction has come of age as well: wilder, more reckless and more breathtaking than previously thought, a wager and a promise that what emerges from the twenty-first century will be as good as any from the twentieth, or the nineteenth."" --Wai Chee Dimock, <i>The New York Times Book Review</i>",Jeff VanderMeer,33919,4.15,2018,2019-10-28,2019-10-28,1,2019

In “The Artist’s Voice” we meet one of the world’s foremost composers, a man who speaks through his ears. A hijacked plane circles a city for twenty years in “Pilot, Copilot, Writer.” Sound can kill in “The Sounds of Early Morning.” And, in the title story, a man is at war with the wife he accidentally shrank. For these characters, the phenomenal isn’t necessarily special—but it’s often dangerous.<br /><br /> In slightly fantastical settings, Gonzales illustrates very real guilt over small and large marital missteps, the intense desire for the reinvention of self, and the powerful urges we feel to defend and provide for the people we love. With wit and insight, these stories subvert our expectations and challenge us to look at our surroundings with fresh eyes.

In ""Home,"" a combat-damaged soldier moves back in with his mother and struggles to reconcile the world he left with the one to which he has returned. And in the title story, a stunning meditation on imagination, memory, and loss, a middle-aged cancer patient walks into the woods to commit suicide, only to encounter a troubled young boy who, over the course of a fateful morning, gives the dying man a final chance to recall who he really is. A hapless, deluded owner of an antique store; two mothers struggling to do the right thing; a teenage girl whose idealism is challenged by a brutal brush with reality; a man tormented by a series of pharmaceutical experiments that force him to lust, to love, to kill—the unforgettable characters that populate the pages of <i>Tenth of December</i> are vividly and lovingly infused with Saunders' signature blend of exuberant prose, deep humanity, and stylistic innovation.<br /><br />Writing brilliantly and profoundly about class, sex, love, loss, work, despair, and war, Saunders cuts to the core of the contemporary experience.

Lewis's Space Trilogy, of which <i>Out of the Silent Planet</i> is the first volume, stands alongside such works as Albert Camus's <i>The Plague</i> and George Orwell's <i>1984 </i>as a timely parable that has become timeless, beloved by succeeding generations as much for the sheer wonder of its storytelling as for the significance of the moral concerns. For the trilogy's central figure, C.S. Lewis created perhaps the most memorable character of his career, the brilliant, clear-eyed, and fiercely brave philologist Dr. Elwin Ransom. Appropriately, Lewis modeled Dr. Ransom after his dear friend J.R.R. Tolkien, for in the scope of its imaginative achievement and the totality of its vision of not one but two imaginary worlds, the Space Trilogy is rivaled in this century only by Tolkien's trilogy <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>. Readers who fall in love with Lewis's fantasy series <i>The Chronicles of Namia</i> as children unfailingly cherish his <i>Space Trilogy</i> as adults; it, too, brings to life strange and magical realms in which epic battles are fought between the forces of light and those of darkness.

With the recent passing of her Chinese immigrant parents, she's had her fill of uncertainty. She's content just to carry on: She goes to work, troubleshoots the teen-targeted Gemstone Bible, watches movies in a Greenpoint basement with her boyfriend.<br /><br />So Candace barely notices when a plague of biblical proportions sweeps New York. Then Shen Fever spreads. Families flee. Companies cease operations. The subways screech to a halt. Her bosses enlist her as part of a dwindling skeleton crew with a big end-date payoff. Soon entirely alone, still unfevered, she photographs the eerie, abandoned city as the anonymous blogger NY Ghost.<br /><br />Candace won't be able to make it on her own forever, though. Enter a group of survivors, led by the power-hungry IT tech Bob. They're traveling to a place called the Facility, where, Bob promises, they will have everything they need to start society anew. But Candace is carrying a secret she knows Bob will exploit. Should she escape from her rescuers?<br /><br />A send-up and takedown of the rituals, routines, and missed opportunities of contemporary life, Ling Ma's <i>Severance </i>is a moving family story, a quirky coming-of-adulthood tale, and a hilarious, deadpan satire. Most important, it's a heartfelt tribute to the connections that drive us to do more than survive.",Ling  Ma,17343848,3.85,2019,2019-05-13,2019-05-11,3,2019

While the anthology makes no claim or attempt to be ""representative"" or ""comprehensive,"" it demonstrates the vibrancy and diversity of science fiction being written in China at this moment.<br /><br />In addition, three essays at the end of the book explore the history of Chinese science fiction publishing, the state of contemporary Chinese fandom, and how the growing interest in science fiction in China has impacted writers who had long labored in obscurity.<br /><br />Stories include: <br />""Goodnight, Melancholy"" by Xia Jia <br />""The Snow of Jinyang"" by Zhang Ran <br />""Broken Stars"" by Tang Fei <br />""Submarines"" by Han Song <br />""Salinger and the Koreans"" by Han Song <br />""Under a Dangling Sky"" by Cheng Jingbo <br />""What Has Passed Shall in Kinder Light Appear"" by Baoshu<br />""The New Year Train"" by Hao Jingfang <br />""The Robot Who Liked to Tell Tall Tales"" by Fei Dao <br />""Moonlight"" by Liu Cixin <br />""The Restaurant at the End of the Universe: Laba Porridge"" by Anna Wu <br />""The First Emperor's Games"" by Ma Boyong <br />""Reflection"" by Gu Shi<br />""The Brain Box"" by Regina Kanyu Wang<br />""Coming of the Light"" by Chen Qiufan <br />""A History of Future Illnesses"" by Chen Qiufan<br /><br />Essays: <br />""A Brief Introduction to Chinese Science Fiction and Fandom,"" by Regina Kanyu Wang, <br />""A New Continent for China Scholars: Chinese Science Fiction Studies"" by Mingwei Song<br />""Science Fiction: Embarrassing No More"" by Fei Dao<br /><br />For more Chinese SF in translation, check out <i>Invisible Planets</i>.",Ken Liu,2917920,3.89,2019,2019-05-10,2019-04-29,12,2019

  </b>
</b>February 1862. The Civil War is less than one year old. The fighting has begun in earnest, and the nation has begun to realize it is in for a long, bloody struggle. Meanwhile, President Lincoln's beloved eleven-year-old son, Willie, lies upstairs in the White House, gravely ill. In a matter of days, despite predictions of a recovery, Willie dies and is laid to rest in a Georgetown cemetery. ""My poor boy, he was too good for this earth,"" the president says at the time. ""God has called him home."" Newspapers report that a grief-stricken Lincoln returns, alone, to the crypt several times to hold his boy's body.<br /><br />From that seed of historical truth, George Saunders spins an unforgettable story of familial love and loss that breaks free of its realistic, historical framework into a supernatural realm both hilarious and terrifying. Willie Lincoln finds himself in a strange purgatory where ghosts mingle, gripe, commiserate, quarrel, and enact bizarre acts of penance. Within this transitional state--called, in the Tibetan tradition, the bardo--a monumental struggle erupts over young Willie's soul.<br /><i><br />Lincoln in the Bardo</i> is an astonishing feat of imagination and a bold step forward from one of the most important and influential writers of his generation. Formally daring, generous in spirit, deeply concerned with matters of the heart, it is a testament to fiction's ability to speak honestly and powerfully to the things that really matter to us. Saunders has invented a thrilling new form that deploys a kaleidoscopic, theatrical panorama of voices to ask a timeless, profound question: How do we live and love when we know that everything we love must end?<b> </b><br /><br />""A luminous feat of generosity and humanism.""--Colson Whitehead, <i>The</i> <i>New York Times Book Review</i><br /><br /><b> ""A masterpiece.""<i>--</i>Zadie Smith</b>",George Saunders,8885,3.76,2018,2018-09-18,2018-09-12,7,2018

In this series of perfectly rendered vignettes, written just as he was starting to find his comic voice, Kurt Vonnegut paints a warm, wise, and funny portrait of life in post—World War II America–a world where squabbling couples, high school geniuses, misfit office workers, and small-town lotharios struggle to adapt to changing technology, moral ambiguity, and unprecedented affluence. <br /><br /> Here are tales both cautionary and hopeful, each brimming with Vonnegut's trademark humor and profound humanism. A family learns the downside of confiding their deepest secrets into a magical invention. A man finds himself in a Kafkaesque world of trouble after he runs afoul of the shady underworld boss who calls the shots in an upstate New York town. A quack psychiatrist turned ""murder counselor"" concocts a novel new outlet for his paranoid patients. While these stories reflect the anxieties of the postwar era that Vonnegut was so adept at capturing– and provide insight into the development of his early style–collectively, they have a timeless quality that makes them just as relevant today as when they were written. It's impossible to imagine any of these pieces flowing from the pen of another writer; each in its own way is unmistakably, quintessentially Vonnegut. <br /><br /> Featuring a Foreword by author and longtime Vonnegut confidant Sidney Offit and illustrated with Vonnegut' s characteristically insouciant line drawings, <b>Look at the Birdie</b> is an unexpected gift for readers who thought his unique voice had been stilled forever–and serves as a terrific introduction to his short fiction for anyone who has yet to experience his genius. <br /><br />Read ""Hello, Red"" and ""The Petrified Ants,"" two of the stories from the collection, as single-story e-books before <b>Look at the Birdie</b> goes on sale. Available wherever e-books are sold.",Kurt Vonnegut,2778055,3.95,2009,2018-07-18,2018-07-16,3,2018
